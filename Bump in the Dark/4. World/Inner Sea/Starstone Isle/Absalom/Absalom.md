description: "Absalom, the City at the Center of the World, has stood at the geographic and metaphorical fulcrum of Inner Sea intrigue for 5 millennia. Indeed, Absalom’s continual influence has shaped not only the face of the planet but the very nature of the cosmos. Its founding is the basis of the calendar system used by nearly all cultures in the hemisphere. More importantly, Absalom is the origin place of four once-mortal gods, and to many, the city is a symbol of the true capacity of humankind. In Absalom, a person can be whatever and whoever they want, and for the right price, it is said, they can procure anything in its grand markets."

  desc: "Absalom is the largest city in the Inner Sea region and is strategically placed to be an ideal staging point for trade. Imports from all over the world, and even from the bottom of the oceans, can be found in Absalom’s many markets and bazaars. Items that would normally be considered uncommon are instead considered common while within the city walls. Some uncommon items, such as those created by specific organizations or hailing from remote regions, might still remain uncommon at the GM’s discretion."
