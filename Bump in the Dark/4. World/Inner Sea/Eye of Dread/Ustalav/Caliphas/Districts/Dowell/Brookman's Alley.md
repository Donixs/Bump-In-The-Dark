## `=this.LocationType`
Urban legends claim that Brookman’s Alley is the most haunted street in all of [[Caliphas]], and that on the night of the full moon, blood bubbles up from the cobbles in the shape of a child’s skipping squares. Anyone who passes through the alley on such nights without treading upon the squares in the proper order supposedly draws the attention of the ghosts who haunt the place. Tales regarding the ghosts’ identity contradict one another, however; some claim they were the sisters Yarri and Yevette, who were mysteriously slain while playing, while others maintain there is but one ghost, the ghost of a Kellid boy stoned to death by the same girls.
