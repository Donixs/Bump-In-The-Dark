Although the Reaping Rock creates an ideal natural harbor, it’s not without its drawbacks. Much of the filth that slips into [[Caliphas]] harbor, be it runoff from industry, drainage from the city sewer, sediment washing along the coastline, or other refuse, becomes trapped within the cove. While a significant amount sinks to the bottom, that which floats upon the black water eventually finds its way to the Devil’s Cut, a filthy quagmire of trash and pollution almost thick enough to walk upon. Scavengers, both animal and human, frequently pick over what washes up in the constantly churning muck, the occasional lost treasure or unlooted body rewarding those with the stomach to face the wretched smell. But some unfortunates tell of tarry things that slip beneath the surface of the muck and drag down any who would steal their reeking treasure.
