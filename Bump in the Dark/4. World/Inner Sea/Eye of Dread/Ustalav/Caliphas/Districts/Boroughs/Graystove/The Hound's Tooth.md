## `=this.LocationType`
Packed every night with craftsmen, stevedores, and others of the city’s working class, the Hound’s Tooth offers little in the way of atmosphere or food, but the drinks are cheap and only lightly watered, which is enough to keep the crowd happy. A former constable, barkeeper [[Shaid Boxmon]] (NG male human ranger 3) lives above the tavern with his wife, Fhanna, and two teenage sons, Quinn and Shaid, Jr. Protective of his family and those he deems worth the effort, Shaid knows more about the dark side of [[Caliphas]] than he is comfortable sharing, and has been known to violently expel patrons from his bar merely for giving him a bad feeling.
