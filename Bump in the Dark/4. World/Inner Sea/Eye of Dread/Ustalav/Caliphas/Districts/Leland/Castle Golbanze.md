## `=this.LocationType`
The shattered skeletons of decades’ worth of wrecked ships strewn below the walls of Castle Golbanze shock many travelers crossing Lake Encarthan, leading some to mistake [[Caliphas]] for a fortress-city only momentarily freed from the grip of war. In truth, [[Caliphas]] hasn’t known invasion from the sea since the Shining Crusade, but the capital of Ustalav is prepared nonetheless. Castle Golbanze looms over the Reaping Rock, vigilant for threats from the waves, its numerous hook- and fire- throwing weapons bristling from its sharp crenellations, while its tower beacons warn vessels away from the jagged rocks below. Facing inland, the fortress’s walls drop toward the docks of the royal navy, where many of Ustalav’s black-and-purple-sailed ships find moorage. Under the command of the honorable Admiral [[Marris Riddian]] (LG female human fighter 9), the fortress and navy keep both the capital and the broader Ustalavic coast safe from threats, and only rarely engage with threats from lake pirates, aquatic monsters, and seafaring Razmiran zealots. Operating under the direction of the admiral, some of the Ustalavic navy’s most famed and infamous ships and captains include the Devilfish, under the command of Captain [[Almira “Cardinal” Perine]] (NG female human ranger 6); the Princess Maraet, the ship of Captain [[Liald Gaspair]] (LE male human bard 5); and the largest vessel in the fleet, the Indomitable, commanded by C[[aptain Leos Tailor]] (LG male human cavalier 8).
