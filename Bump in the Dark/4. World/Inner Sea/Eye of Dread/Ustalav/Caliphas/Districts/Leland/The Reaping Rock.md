## `=this.LocationType`
The rugged natural breakwater that shelters the city harbor, the cliffs collectively known as the Reaping Rock have brought both life and death to [[Caliphas]]. The cliffs are a great boon to the city, sheltering both the countryâ€™s naval and merchant fleets from the storms that frequently blow across Lake Encarthan. Yet the mossy cliffs have also spelled doom for dozens of vessels, as hidden rocks conspire with unpredictable winds and currents to send whole crews to their deaths within sight of a safe harbor. The broken hulls of dozens of ships lie strewn along the length of the Rock, the most infamous being the wreck of the Silver Star, crashed by a heartbroken navigator, and the Trackless, a vessel lost 40 years ago that reappeared during a storm in 4710 AR and wrecked upon the cliff, with no signs of the crew ever found.
