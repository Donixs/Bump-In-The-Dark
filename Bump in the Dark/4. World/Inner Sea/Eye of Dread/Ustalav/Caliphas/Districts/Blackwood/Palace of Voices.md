## `=this.LocationType`
The royal theater and opera, the Palace of Voices stands as the pinnacle of society and entertainment for the Ustalavic elite. Brother and sister [[Paulo Carameizta]] (NE male human bard 4) and [[Marrian Carameizta]](CE female human rogue 5) own the theater, having jointly inherited it from their deceased parents. Although both love the stage and the storm of society and prestige that surrounds it, they loathe one another and have diametrically opposed philosophies on how to run the centuries-old opera. While the owners nurse childhood grudges and petty rivalries, the staff and stage company look to conductor [[Aldentor Rudono]] (N male bard 9) for leadership. Rudono is an aging musical genius who leads the theater to riveting season after season, while keeping up a love-hate relationship with Headmistress [[Calmadra Vhalikackos]] of the [[Karcau Opera]].
