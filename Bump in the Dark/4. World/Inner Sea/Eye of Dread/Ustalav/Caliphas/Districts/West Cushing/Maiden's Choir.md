## `=this.LocationType`
The royal church of Pharasma counts most of the city’s pious among its congregation. Mother [[Verith Thestia]] (N female cleric 12) presides over the ancient and impressively domed structure, which has existed in some form since even before the reign of the Whispering Tyrant. Some whisper that a horrifying remnant of the lich lord’s rule still lies locked away in the temple’s catacombs, but both Mother Thestia and [[Zetiah Mardhalas]] (LN female inquisitor 6), the cathedral’s merciless exorcist, deny such claims.
