>> [[The Archivist]] would advise the party that he had received a letter from an old friend, who was signed on to be an [[Caeddwyn Cemwic|actor]] in a rather strange play. The letter states that [[Caeddwyn Cemwic|Caeddwyn]], the actor, was given an acting job through an envelope slipped under his door. The play was titled [[Tattered Yellows (play)|Tattered Yellows]], and normally he'd toss out any job offer that isn't located through his agent, but the oddity of the recruitment intrigued him. To his surprise, one actress he was acquaintances with also received a similar envelope. The envelopes contained instructions to leave a yes/no response in a particular mailbox. A week later after giving his 'yes', he received a new envelope slipped under his door once more. This one was considerably more thicker, and contained instructions and the actors lines. It did not contain a full script of the play, only his lines. The script gave cues/tone for what the other characters were saying/doing, but was very vague otherwise outside of their own lines. The play contains five acts, and the first act begun to feel familiar to [[Caeddwyn Cemwic|Caeddwyn]], and as he read the second act he realized what he might be reading. He dare not write what he [[The King In Yellow (play)|suspects]], lest draw attention from [[hastur-logm|iillicit spectra]]. He quickly wrote a letter to [[The Archivist]] stating that he was going to confirm this by checking the local academy for a copy and that if he does not hear from him within the next few days, that something has gone wrong. [[The Archivist]] has no interest in waiting, and is sending the party out immediately. 
>>  The party will investigate the local academy to find the actor and what book they were looking for. 
>>  Whatever they report to [[The Archivist]], he will order them to investigate the play, with two direct objectives. Stop the play early, and find out who the director is. 
>>  The party will need to somehow sneak into the play as stage hands or otherwise
