> [!info|bg-c-purple]- Overview
The party is given an unusual case, a paid request. The [[The Archivist]] explains that their work has not gone unnoticed, and a patron wishes to hire them. While normally they'd turn down such requests, funding is necessary and the patron is a rather wealthy Noble man who lives in [[Karcau]], the Village of Voices in [[Sinaria]]. He apparently has traveled out o Caliphas to greet the group and give them their mission. [[The Archivist]] warns the party that if the party suspects the mission is, to doubt the nobleman's intentions. If it's a mission to kill a monster haunting his manor, find out why it's haunting his manor. If it's to retrieve something, find out what the item is and is there any threat to it, etc. If it turns out the Noble has bad intentions, break the mission and contain/neutralize any paranormal threats.
Party meets nobleman [[Matho Thorneheart]], Duke of [[Vauntil]]. The duke needs a painting that is currently 'lost' in the [[Thrushmoor| the town of Thrushmoor]]. ;
