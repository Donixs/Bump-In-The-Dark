Write a fantasy quest scenario involving the investigation into a village who secretly hosts a cult dedicated to a Brimorak, a firey demon who loves to burn things down.The kingdom is in chaos as reports of mysterious fires popping up in various villages have been flooding the royal palace. The King has ordered his bravest and most skilled warriors to investigate the source of these fires and put a stop to them before they spread any further.

Upon arriving at one of the affected villages, the warriors quickly realize that there is something sinister going on here. The villagers seem to be hiding something from them, and they are unwilling to speak about it. However, after some intense interrogation, one of the villagers confesses that they are secretly hosting a cult dedicated to Brimorak, a fiery demon who loves burning things down.

The warriors now know what they're up against and set out on a quest to find this cult and put an end to its evil deeds. They scour the village for clues and eventually come across an underground lair where the cult is performing dark rituals dedicated to Brimorak.

The warriors quickly spring into action, engaging in a fierce battle with the cult members. As they fight their way through the lair, they discover that Brimorak's power has been growing stronger with each sacrifice made in his name.

Finally, after defeating all of the cult members and destroying their hideout, they come face-to-face with Brimorak himself. The demon is massive and radiates intense heat as he looms over them. With swords drawn and hearts racing, the warriors fight bravely against Brimorak until finally defeating him in a furious battle.

With Brimorak's defeat, the village is safe once again. The warriors return home as heroes with tales of their epic battle against a fiery demon that threatened their kingdom. The people of the village are grateful for their bravery and will forever remember those who saved them from certain doom at the hands of Brimorak's cult.
