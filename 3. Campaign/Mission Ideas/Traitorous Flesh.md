> [!info|bg-c-purple]- Overview
>> [[The Archivist]] would advise the party that the treasure hunting ship [[The Burslem]] had arrived at the [[Caliphas (Capital)|Caliphas]] dock under strange circumstances. The report is that there boat docked two weeks later than it was scheduled to return, and only a sole ship hand survived, who disappeared immediately after the ship docked. Reports of what the guards saw on the ship is mixed, but all describe the scene as grisly. The ship was supposed to be retrieving some strange artifact from a fallen meteorite that landed in the Inner Sea and bring it back to a wealthy collector in [[Caliphas (Capital)|Caliphas]].  [[The Archivist]] would provide the party with the case file and advise of the location of the where the [[The Burslem]]. the party will investigate the docks, either persuading/intimidating the guards into talking about the report or investigating the boat themselves, either with permission or sneaking on. Party will get leads into strange disappearing deckhand. Investigation will lead into recent string of killings that happened since the arrival of the ship.****
>>  A lead will be given to the Adventurers  investigate disappearances in [[The Cairns]], refugees and immigrants have disappeared and the local guard has not really investigated it. Potentially run idea of the refugees of Lastwall and Kellid refugees/immigrants be pitted against each other when it was the monster creating the issues and the lack of care/support from the guard/city. Party stumbles upon a killing, learning of the shapeshifting nature of their target [[The Flesh]]. Party determines best way to hunt the beast, and either captures or kills it. If they contact [[The Archivist]] in the mean time of this investigation, he will want it alive if possible, or atleast the corpse brought back.
