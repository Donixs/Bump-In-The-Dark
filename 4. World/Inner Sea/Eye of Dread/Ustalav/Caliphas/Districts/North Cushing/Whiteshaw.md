## `=this.LocationType`
A squat, fortresslike wall surrounds the plain stone building at the corner of White Avenue and Shaw Street, the headquarters of the [[Caliphas]] Department of Constables and Investigators. The gruff, jaded Captain [[Boverde Hoptler]]  is officially responsible for running the department, as well as for holding the broader mandate of “ensuring the safety of [[Caliphas]] and all its people.” However, the small Bureau of Special Affairs, overseen by [[Mirakas Vashalnt]], also works out of Whiteshaw. The mysterious agency exists outside Hoptler’s command, instead reporting directly to the prince’s advisor, [[Diauden]] .
