## `=this.LocationType`
Guardian over [[Caliphas]]’s harbor and west gate, Castle Mashir serves triple duty as military bastion, seat of the city’s port authority, and prison. The fortress’s three facets function with near autonomy, though the humorless Brigadier [[Holladyne Vronds]] (LN male human fighter 7) presides as the official commander. So named for its lack of exterior entrances, the Gateless Tower is the fort’s prison, its squat shape and thick walls housing [[Caliphas]]’s most dangerous prisoners. Warden [[Browden Celdmoor]] (LN male human expert 5) takes his role as rehabilitator especially seriously, extolling the virtues of Pharasma’s worship and forced labor. The office of Harbormaster [[Jasaline Morstenni]] (LG female human rogue 5) overlooks the city’s busy western docks. Strict and stern when it comes to matters of nautical taxes and safety, Morstenni holds the respect of her officers and regulars on the city’s docks, her charm and good looks easing the sting of the citations and fines typically left in her wake.
