## `=this.LocationType`
Numerous families of Kellid descent cram into several tightly packed blocks of tenements and aggrandized shacks. Vying for more space, the residents have taken to building elaborate cellars, many of which connect to a maze of shared halls and communal living spaces. Among the alleys and ramshackle courtyards topside stand numerous distinctly Kellid decorations, including crude menhirs of wood and scrap metal, the graffiti on some bearing bold similarities to glyphs associated with the strictly outlawed shamanistic Kellid faiths of old. The noseless crone [[Brynran Khoraseid]], the oldest resident of the Cairns, is regarded as grandmother and leader by much of [[Caliphas]]â€™s impoverished Kellid population.
