 The Haraday Theater no longer entertains the citizens of Caliphas, as newer and more accessible venues have long since supplanted it in importance. It amply serves the needs of the [[Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye]], however, who purchased the theater and now use it for official gatherings and ceremonies. The Order occasionally rents out some of the facilityâ€™s smaller rooms to their own members for private functions, and operates an exclusive lounge on the side.
