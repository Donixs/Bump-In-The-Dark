Beneath the tarnished bronze sword of a Taldan knight, a granite block bears the family names of the 12,488 souls who gave their lives to wrest [[Caliphas]] from the grip of the Whispering Tyrant. Although [[Iomedae]]’s faith largely died out in the city over 80 years ago, the Andoran priest [[Indrenen “Oak” Corbakas]] (LG male human cleric 9) led a small mission of Iomedaeans to [[Caliphas]] 4 years ago and consecrated a new shrine on the memorial grounds. Since the reestablishment of Dawngrace, the clergy has garnered few adherents, the locals proving resistant to turning from the Pharasmin traditions of their people. The Iomedaeans’ hopes of reclaiming the [[Abbey of Sante-Lymirin]], situated to the north of the city, and rededicating it as a center of Iomedae’s worship have also met with frustration, as negotiations are bogged down in a bureaucratic quagmire aggravated by the abbey’s current owner, Countess [[Carmilla Caliphvaso]].
