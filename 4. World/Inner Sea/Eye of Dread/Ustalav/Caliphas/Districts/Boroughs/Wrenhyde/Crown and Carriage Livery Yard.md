## `=this.LocationType`
Many of [[Caliphas]]’s nobles board their personal steeds at the Crown and Carriage, the city’s most prestigious stables. Owner [[Ullammo Torisi]] has ties to the [[Whitestaff Ranch]] in [[Canterwall]], and occasionally has fine steeds for sale—including the fell ponies popular among riders of many of the nation’s rockier counties.
