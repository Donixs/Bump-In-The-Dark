## `=this.LocationType`
Cluttered with debris and harbor trash, this out of use slipway serves as the traditional disposal site for beaten or murdered traitors and deserters. Locals—especially sailors and stevedores—regard being left in the filthy brine of the Drop as a particularly disgraceful end, making it a popular place to ditch the dead or half-dead. The establishment of a constabulary post nearby has not decreased the Drop’s use, and constables on watch frequently marvel over bodies discovered in the morning despite no one having been observed approaching the slipway all night.
