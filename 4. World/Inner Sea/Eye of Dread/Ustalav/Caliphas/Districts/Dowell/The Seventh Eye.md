## `=this.LocationType`
Incongruously situated amid several warehouses near the cityâ€™s eastern docks, this strange restaurant keeps unpredictable hours. The Seventh Eye only opens when its owner, the mysterious Dr. Low (LE male human sorcerer 10), wishes it. Few beyond his network of agents have ever met Dr. Low face to face, but reports invariably describe him as an unfailingly polite and well-cultured man of obvious Tian descent, with some honoring him as a mystic and genius, while others curse him as a criminal and sadist. For years, the city constabulary has sought to pin charges of kidnapping, smuggling, slavery, illegal magic, murder, and other crimes on the imperturbable foreigner, only to have their leads evaporate or witnesses vanish at the last moment.
