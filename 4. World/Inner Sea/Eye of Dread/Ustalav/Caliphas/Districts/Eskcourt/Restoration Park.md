## `=this.LocationType`

In the shadow of Castle Stryithe sprawls the fastidiously manicured gardens and lawns of the city’s largest park. Managed by the reclusive druid [[Merrick Sais]] as warden of the park. The park is open from dawn to dusk, but closed at night. A

## Sights

### Sesasgia Calipvaso Memorial
Within the park is the Sesasgia Caliphvaso Memorial, a life sized alabaster statute mounted on a block of granite depicting Sesasgia Caliphvaso, the countess who refounded the city of Caliphas after the defeat of the [[Whispering Tyrant]]. 

### Standing Stones
Part of Merrick's agreement was the commission of the  Standing Stones, a trio of standing  stones that mark the park as the druid's sacred grove. Blood can sometimes be seen on them, which people generally chalk up to vague druidic rituals. 

### Reflecting Pool
 Tall columns line both sides of this reflecting pool, commissioned by Ilmhost Vheist, a scholar and early leader of Ustalav, in the aftermath of the Shining Crusade as a reminder to the inhabitants of Caliphas of the dangers the nation has faced over its proud history. The tall columns along the pool’s south side are carved in the likeness of Ustalavic soldiers facing a menagerie of threatening creatures carved on the pillars on the far side, including Kellid barbarians, Belkzen orcs, werewolves, and the undead knights of the Whispering Tyrant. This latter group includes both a headless dullahan as well as an armored blood knight. A sturdy stone footbridge crosses the pool, joining a path that ventures deeper into the park.

### The Valiant Charge 
A massive statute dominates this clearing, depicting [[Soividia Ustav]], the founder of Ustalav, astride a rampant destrier with an upraised blade.

### Pond of Contemplation
Merrick created this natural pond through a combination of  **Move Earth** and **control water** spells. She finds its natural contours much more soothing than the reflecting pool. She often visits here at night and even during the day as well, by casting **tree stride** and remaining within the tree trunks to look out upon a world.

### The Glass House
The Glass House is a massive structure, towering 40 feet tall, easily as high as many of the park’s trees. A relatively recent addition to the park, the greenhouse showcases a variety of flowering plants imported from warmer climes, and draws many visitors each year. Huge glass windows stretch between the greenhouse’s iron frameworks.
