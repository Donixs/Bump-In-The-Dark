The seat of Ustalav’s government seems the perfect setting for treachery. Beneath a crown of needle-sharp spires and knotting buttresses, the vast and ominous structure holds the throne of Ustalav’s prince, the 16 stations of the Hall of Peers that make up Ustalav’s fractious congress of counts, the Gallery of Ancestors portrait hall, and numerous meeting chambers, treasuries, libraries, rooms for visiting ambassadors, and other luxuries of the nation’s rulers. Yet some claim that the castle wasn’t built for the princes of Ustalav alone, but also for those who would oppose them, with secret chambers, arsenals, traps, and passages lurking throughout the castle, as well as a secret command center capable of turning the entire palace into a deathtrap with the flip of a lever.
