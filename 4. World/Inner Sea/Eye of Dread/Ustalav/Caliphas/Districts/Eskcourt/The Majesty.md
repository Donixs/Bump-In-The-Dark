## `=this.LocationType`
An endless river of visiting nobles and dignitaries passes through [[Caliphas]], and all expect to indulge in the same opulent accommodations they demand at home. Catering to the elite of the elite—as only they can afford the extravagant prices—the Majesty Hotel rises four stories and boasts more than 100 rooms, several decorated in themes to make guests from foreign countries or climes more comfortable. Four lavish suites sprawl across the penthouse floor, though of these only three are ever rented, as the owner, [[Orenthal Rightier]] , refuses to ever let Room 404.
