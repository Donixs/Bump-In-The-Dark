The smell of cloves and cinnamon dominates the cramped, smoky tea house of the veiled Vudrani fortune-teller Tidadimara (CN female human rogue 4). In truth, though, there’s not a Vudrani splinter in all of Mists and Dreams—the “imported” teas are mixtures of local varieties, the “naga” over the bar is in fact the head of a Garundi mercenary stitched to the body of an overlarge blacksnake, and [[Seleis “Tidadimara” Savoisi]] was born in [[Magnimar]], not [[Bannaquet ]]as she claims (and which she mispronounces as “Bana-quaint”). The true business of Mists and Dreams takes place in its cellars, where Tidadimara runs a pesh den selling the concoctions of the mysterious [[Dr. Low]].
