Specializing in Taldan cuisine, the restaurant of Chef [[Vido Caldoveri]] (N male human bard 4) ranks among the finest in [[Caliphas]]. Part of its appeal comes from its mystery, as Caldoveri closely guards the secret of his menu—which changes nightly, supposedly without repetition—and exotic ingredients. Unless one is royalty, reservations to dine at Dalliance must be placed months in advance, and while the prices prove as extravagant as the mysterious multiple-course meals, the house’s lavish amenities—like private dining rooms, skilled musicians, individual wait staff, and personal food tasters—make the experience well worth the cost.
