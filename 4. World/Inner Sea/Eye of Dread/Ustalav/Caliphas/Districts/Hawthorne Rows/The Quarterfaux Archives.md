The hundreds of thousands of relics, rarities, curiosities and documents that make up the royal collection of Ustalav reside in the cold vaults, libraries, and exhibits collectively known as the Quarterfaux Archives. While only a fraction of the collection is kept on display, scholars and students from among the country’s most elite families come here to study under some of the greatest—if most conservative—minds in the nation. Very few are allowed access to the greater collection, typically only those of noble lineage whose families have made significant donations to the museum, but even then there are still certain works and artifacts that can only be viewed with the written permission of the museum’s head curator, [[Regan Saramul]] (LN female bard 7).
