## `=this.LocationType`
Traders and travelers across [[Ustalav]] and beyond curse the name Balatz, [[Caliphas]]’s main trade gate. All merchants and newcomers to the city must enter through the fanglike portcullises of the fortress, where taxes are levied and travelers are documented. Although the members of the city constabulary who guard the gate are susceptible to taking bribes, the gazes of the military patrols minding the castle walls often deter even the greediest guards. Balatz also holds the offices of General [[Drannon Ulvodos]] , head of the Ustalavic army, and of his support staff. While the aging general has never seen battle—his father having won him the title in a decades-old political machination—he seeks every opportunity to indulge his power, constantly counseling the prince to warlike ends.
