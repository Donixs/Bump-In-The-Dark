## Old Lore

Dr. [[Beaurigmand Trice ]] firmly believes that humans hold the power within themselves to help one another. To this end, he has pursued a life as a healer, yet he forgoes reliance on divine magic. Through a lengthy career, his interests have come to focus on maladies of the mind, the study and healing of which brought him to construct Havenguard Lunatic Asylum. Many in [[Caliphas]] misunderstand Dr. Trice’s intentions and unconventional treatments, viewing the asylum as a prison or house of horrors. Yet the good doctor has been able to help untold numbers of unfortunates, and for those whom he can’t aid medically, Trice relies upon his position as a Pathfinder venture-captain to find others capable of offering assistance. To this end, he maintains Ustalav’s largest Pathfinder lodge on his hospice’s grounds.  With the asylum’s seemingly endless number of patients, Trice has come to rely more and more on his assistant [[Cereis Linas]], especially in regard to the fascinating but frightening case of [[Mr. Tembs]], a confessed but unconfirmed murderer with at least three deadly personalities.

## New Lore
Located in Ustalav’s capital, [[Caliphas]], the Vodavani Lodge—still sometimes referred to as the Havenguard Asylum—doubles as an institution for the treatment of mental illnesses. The chief healer of the lodge, Dr. Beaurigmand Trice ,   is a pioneer of affirming non-magical treatments, and he offers his services to Pathfinder agents free of charge. Dr. Trice also served as the lodge’s venture-captain until the return of the Whispering Tyrant, after which a massive spike in demand for his services convinced him to hand over his other tasks to Venture-Captain [[Evni Zongnoss]] , who lost her own lodge in the wake of the Tyrant’s destruction.
