## `=this.LocationType`
Countess [[Carmilla Caliphvaso ]], ruler of both [[Caliphas]] city and county, makes her home within this palace of crimson flowers and ruby glass. Her frequent galas number among the most prestigious social events in the city, and regularly include invitations to members of the lower classes who have managed to capture the countess’s attentions. These fetes are typically of such decadence that participants regularly cannot remember the festivities—or go missing altogether.
