While [[Castle Golbanze]] is [[Caliphas]]’s shield against threats from the sea, Borgoffi is the city’s rusting sword. Bristling with ballistae and mangonels, the fortress boasts a vast arsenal of deadly projectiles, including hull-perforating spears, alchemist’s fire bombs, and casks of quicklime. The castle’s eccentric master of arms, [[Ritambros Deymarian]] , also experiments in the development of new weapons of war, and has been known to pay for such strange materials as molds from the [[Darklands]], undead body parts, and diseased rats to employ in the creation of his prototype arms and ammunitions. Yet for all of its armaments, Borgoffi sees little action outside of regularly scheduled exercises. Colonel [[Joelm Colmar]], the commanding officer of the fortress, resents his position, seeing the post as a boring career cul-de-sac. On most days, he entertains himself by tending to his two dozen pet ravens, kept in an expansive coop on the castle’s roof.
