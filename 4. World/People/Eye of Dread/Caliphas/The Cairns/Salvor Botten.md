Salvor Botten was a woman of peace, a gentle leader who cared deeply for the Lastwall refugees under hher care. Born and raised in Lastwall, Salvor had witnessed firsthand the horrors of war and knew all too well the toll it took on those caught in its wake.

When the undead hordes of [[Tar-Baphon]] descended upon Lastwall, Salvor and his family were among the lucky few who managed to escape with their lives. They fled north, seeking refuge in [[Caliphas (Capital)| Caliphas, Capital of Ustalav]] , where they eventually found safety in a small community of other refugees.

Over time, Salvor emerged as a natural leader among the group. She was kind, compassionate, and always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need. She worked tirelessly to ensure that everyone had enough food and shelter, and that nobody went without medical care or basic necessities.

Despite his peaceful nature, Salvor was not one to back down from a fight if it meant protecting her people. She organized patrols to keep watch in [[The Cairns]], and trained many of the refugees in basic self-defense techniques.

Under Salvor's guidance, the community thrived. They built homes and farms, formed close bonds with one another, and even managed to establish trade relations with nearby settlements. Many refugees came to see Salvor as a mother figure or trusted friend.
