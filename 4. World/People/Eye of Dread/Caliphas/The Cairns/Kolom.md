Kolom was born and raised in the harsh land of Sarkoris, a place that was once filled with lush forests and fertile grounds, but now only remained as a barren wasteland due to the demonic invasion. He was one of the fortunate few who managed to escape with his family before the demons could claim their lives.

Kolom, along with his family and many others, sought refuge in Ustalav. However, life in Ustalav was not easy for the Kellid refugees as they faced discrimination and prejudice from some of the locals. Kolom knew that he had to do something to help his people.

He became a respected elder among the Kellid immigrants and used his wisdom and experience to guide them through their struggles. Kolom worked tirelessly to ensure that his people had access to basic necessities such as food, shelter, and healthcare. He also acted as a mediator between the Kellids and the city of [[Caliphas (Capital)| Caliphas]].

Despite facing many challenges throughout his life, Kolom remained steadfast in his beliefs that everyone deserved respect and dignity regardless of their background or circumstances. His reputation extends outside [[The Cairns]] as the "wiseman of the slums".
