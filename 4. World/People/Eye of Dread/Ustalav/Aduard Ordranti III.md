## History
As the second son of Princess Maraet Ordranti and Duke Ardeten Holtzver, Aduard Ordranti never expected to rule. By the time Aduard reached his majority, it was obvious he had little taste for the life of a pampered princeling, possessing a hearty constitution, a headstrong disposition, and a predilection for the outdoors, hunting, and the company of soldiers. After completing his schooling, Aduard traveled the country’s wilder reaches, hunting and touring the forts of the northern and western borders and discovering an appreciation for military life. Such forays led him into danger on numerous occasions, against both beasts and lawless raiders. This willingness to face danger and his dismissal of class boundaries won Aduard widespread favor with the country’s fighting men, yet marked him as an embarrassment at the royal court. 

Although the death of his brother and his own ascendance to the throne had never been his desire, Aduard accepted it as Pharasma’s will, taking the throne at age 29. Rough, unprepared, and overly trusting in his divine right to lead, the early years of Aduard’s reign were characterized by brashness and political naiveté at a time in which eastern Ardeal was scoured by the War without Rivals. In the 36 years since, Aduard continues to put great faith in Pharasma’s guidance and an adopted tradition of military stoicism, but has also grown more skilled at manipulating political rivals. He still despises endless debates, leading to occasional flares of ire and abrupt ends to courtly proceedings. Although he tries—poorly—not to let his private opinions show, the prince loathes Count Neska and Countess Caliphvaso for their arrogance and endless scheming, and finds the Palatinates’ endlessly changing spokespersons simpering cowards, but enjoys a kindred spirit and dependable political ally in Amaans’s Count Galdana.
